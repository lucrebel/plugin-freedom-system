# Stage 5 In Progress: GUI Implementation

Phases 5.1 (Layout) and 5.2 (Parameter Binding) complete. Ready for Phase 5.3 (LED Meter).

## Completed Phases

### Phase 5.1: Layout and Basic Controls ✓

- ✓ UI files created (index.html, index.js, check_native_interop.js)
- ✓ CMakeLists.txt updated with binary resources
- ✓ PluginEditor with std::unique_ptr members (Pattern #11)
- ✓ Explicit URL mapping resource provider (Pattern #8)
- ✓ Window size: 500×300px
- ✓ Industrial rack aesthetic rendering
- ✓ 4 knobs visible (not interactive yet)
- ✓ LED meter visible (not animated yet)
- ✓ Build verification (compiles successfully)

### Phase 5.2: Parameter Binding and Interaction ✓

- ✓ Relative drag for all 4 knobs (Pattern #16 - frame-delta)
- ✓ valueChangedEvent listeners (Pattern #15 - getNormalisedValue())
- ✓ Value formatting per parameter-spec.md
- ✓ Bidirectional sync (UI ↔ DSP)
- ✓ Mouse wheel support
- ✓ Double-click reset to defaults
- ✓ Build verification (compiles successfully)

## Stage 4 Complete: DSP Implementation

All 3 DSP phases complete. Audio processing fully operational.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 4.1: Core Reverb Engine ✓

- ✓ juce::dsp::Reverb with modern API (Pattern #17)
- ✓ juce::dsp::DryWetMixer for dry/wet blending
- ✓ SIZE → roomSize mapping (0.3-1.0)
- ✓ DAMPING → damping coefficient (0.0-1.0)
- ✓ MIX → wet mix proportion
- ✓ ScopedNoDenormals protection
- ✓ Build verification (compiles successfully)

### Phase 4.2: Built-in Modulation System ✓

- ✓ Dual LFO state (0.3Hz left, 0.5Hz right)
- ✓ Delay line with Lagrange 3rd-order interpolation
- ✓ ±3% pitch modulation depth (always-on)
- ✓ Post-reverb, pre-dry/wet routing
- ✓ Phase wrapping at 2π
- ✓ Build verification (compiles successfully)

### Phase 4.3: Shimmer Pitch Shifter ✓

- ✓ 2048-point FFT phase vocoder with 4x overlap
- ✓ Hann windowing for smooth analysis/synthesis
- ✓ Frequency bin resampling (+12 semitones / +1 octave)
- ✓ SHIMMER parameter (0-100%, bypass at 0%)
- ✓ Pre-reverb routing (shimmer feeds reverb input)
- ✓ Overlap-add synthesis
- ✓ Build verification (compiles successfully)

## Stage 3 Complete: Shell

APVTS implemented with all 4 parameters. State persistence operational.

## Completed This Stage

- ✓ SIZE parameter (0.5-20s, logarithmic skew, default 2.5s)
- ✓ DAMPING parameter (0-100%, linear, default 30%)
- ✓ SHIMMER parameter (0-100%, linear, default 30%)
- ✓ MIX parameter (0-100%, linear, default 30%)
- ✓ String conversion lambdas (correct display formats)
- ✓ State persistence (getStateInformation/setStateInformation)
- ✓ Build verification (compiles successfully)

## Next Phase: Phase 5.3 (LED Output Meter)

**Goal:** Real-time output level visualization with ballistics

**Components:**
- C++ peak level detection (PluginProcessor)
- Atomic float for level transfer (C++ → JavaScript)
- JavaScript meter rendering with requestAnimationFrame loop (Pattern #20)
- Ballistic motion (fast attack, slow release)
- Traffic light thresholds:
  - Green: -60dB to -12dB
  - Yellow: -12dB to -3dB
  - Red: -3dB to 0dB
- Throttled updates (60fps max)

**Estimated duration:** 25 minutes

## Command to Continue

```bash
/continue LushVerb
```

Or proceed directly to Stage 4 from current workflow session.
