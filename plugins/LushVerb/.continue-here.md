# Ready for Implementation

Planning complete. All contracts created:
- ✓ creative-brief.md
- ✓ parameter-spec.md
- ✓ architecture.md
- ✓ plan.md

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
**Stage 1:** ✓ Complete
- Complexity score: 5.0 (maximum - complex)
- Strategy: Phase-based implementation
- Estimated duration: ~4.5 hours
- Plan documented with 3 DSP phases + 3 GUI phases

## Complexity Breakdown

- Parameters: 4 (SIZE, DAMPING, SHIMMER, MIX) = 0.8 points
- Algorithms: 4 DSP components = 4 points
  - juce::dsp::Reverb
  - Custom shimmer (phase vocoder)
  - Dual LFO modulation
  - DryWetMixer
- Features: FFT processing + modulation = 2 points
- **Total: 5.0 (capped at maximum)**

## Next Steps

1. Stage 2: Foundation (create build system via /implement)
2. Review plan.md details
3. Adjust complexity assessment
4. Pause here

## Key Risks

- Phase 4.3: Shimmer phase vocoder (90 min, high complexity)
  - Fallback: Delay-based granular (30 min, lower quality)
- SIZE parameter: Custom scaling needed for 0.5-20s range
- Performance target: 50-60% CPU (acceptable for high-quality reverb)

Run `/implement LushVerb` to begin Stage 2 (Foundation).
